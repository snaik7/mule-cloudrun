# Mule Cloud Run Application #mule-cloudrun
Running mule application on Cloud Run

Download Mule Runtime from http://s3.amazonaws.com/new-mule-artifacts/mule-ee-distribution-standalone-3.9.4-hf1.zip and add at root of repo. Mule Runtime size is more than 100 MB so I can not add to github repo. 

The repo is part of article - https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/serverless-mule-service-google-cloud-run-santosh-naik/?trackingId=PVQb2wgzS%2F636A3Y4qpIXQ%3D%3D
